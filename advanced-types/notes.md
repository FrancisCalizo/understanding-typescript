## Intersection Types

An intersection type combines multiple types into one. It allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need.

In the case of a union type, it will take the types that they have in common. For an object type, it will take the combination of the object properties.

## Type Guards

A type guard is any expression that performs a runtime check that guarantees the type in some scope. This ensures that the variable is the type you're expecting at the moment your code is executed.

Three examples of type guards are:

1. typeof - check the type of a variable
2. of - check if something is a property of an object
3. instanceof - check if some object is based on a certain class
