--In TS, you can add a parameter 'this' into a method inside of a class to be a hint to what a this is refering to. You can then assign a type to it.

-`private` keyword will make a property/method accessible from only inside the class

-Shorthand initialization inside constructor method so we don't have to define both it above and in the constructor method

-readonly available for extra type safety for properties in a class
